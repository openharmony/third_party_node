/**
 * @brief Adds a tensor to a model instance.
 *
 * The data node and operator parameters in the Neural Network Runtime model are composed of tensors of the model. 
 * This method is used to add tensors to a model instance based on the <b>tensor</b> parameter. 
 * The sequence of adding tensors is specified by the index value recorded in the model. The {@link OH_NNModel_SetTensorData}, {@link OH_NNModel_AddOperation}, 
 * and {@link OH_NNModel_SpecifyInputsAndOutputs} methods specifies tensors based on the index value. \n
 *
 * Neural Network Runtime supports inputs and outputs of the dynamic shape. When adding a data node with a dynamic shape, 
 * you need to set the dimensions that support dynamic changes in <b>tensor.dimensions</b> to <b>-1</b>. 
 * For example, if <b>tensor.dimensions</b> of a four-dimensional tensor is set to <b>[1, -1, 2, 2]</b>, the second dimension supports dynamic changes. \n
 *
 * @param model Pointer to the {@link OH_NNModel} instance.
 * @param tensor Pointer to the {@link OH_NN_Tensor} tensor. The tensor specifies the attributes of the tensor added to the model instance. 
 * @return Execution result of the function. If the operation is successful, <b>OH_NN_SUCCESS</b> is returned. 
 *         If the operation fails, an error code is returned. For details about the error codes, see {@link OH_NN_ReturnCode}.

 * type, and quantization parameters. \n
 *
 * Neural Network Runtime supports models with dynamical shape input. For fixed shape input and dynamic shape input scenarios, 
 * this method uses different processing policies. \n
 *
 * - Fixed shape input: The attributes of <b>tensor</b> must be the same as those of the tensor added by calling 
 *   {@link OH_NNModel_AddTensor} in the composition phase.
 * - Dynamic shape input: In the composition phase, because the shape is not fixed, each value in <b>tensor.dimensions</b> must be greater than 
 *   <b>0</b> in the method calls to determine the shape input in the calculation phase. When setting the shape, you can modify 
 *   only the dimension whose value is <b>-1</b>. Assume that <b>[-1, 224, 224, 3]</b> is input as the the dimension of A in the composition phase. 
 *   When this method is called, only the size of the first dimension can be modified, for example, to <b>[3, 224, 224, 3]</b>. 
 *   If other dimensions are adjusted, {@link OH_NN_INVALID_PARAMETER} is returned. \n

 *                   In input settings, the index value for the three inputs is <b>{0, 1, 2}</b>. \n
 *
 * @param tensor Sets the tensor corresponding to the input data.
 * @param dataBuffer Pointer to the input data.
